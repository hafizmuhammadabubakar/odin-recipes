    <h1>Chef John's Taco- Stuffed Zucchini Boats</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Zucchini is not very exciting, interesting, or fun to eat, 
        which is basically the opposite of a taco. 
        But what we're going to do here is use the same filling 
        used to make tacos to stuff zucchini and turn something 
        that's generally unremarkable into something that is incredibly remarkable. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn't some kind of low-carb substitute gimmick--these really were amazing. 
        Serve topped with diced tomato, green onions, sour cream, and cilantro, 
        or any toppings you prefer. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 table spoon olive oil</li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced yellow onion </li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced jalapeno pepper </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornmeal </li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce </li>
        <li>½ cup water </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine olive oil, onion, and ground beef in a skillet over high heat. 
            Cook, stirring, until onion turns translucent and the beef is browned 
            and broken up into very small pieces, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 
            jalapeno pepper and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 
            chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, dried oregano, cornmeal, 
            and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to 
            medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens 
            to your desired texture, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set 
            aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a teaspoon or melon baller to scoop out about half the center of 
            each zucchini to create a "boat." Sprinkle generously with remaining 
            kosher salt and let sit, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a paper towel to blot any moisture that the salt draws out of the 
            zucchini. Place boats on the prepared baking sheet and fill each one 
            with as much taco meat mixture as will fit. 
            Top evenly with pepper Jack cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is browned and the zucchini 
            is just barely tender, about 20 minutes. Test for doneness with a sharp knife. 
            Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
